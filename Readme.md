# Lane-Following and Autonomous Parking Car

This project showcases a self-driving car that is capable of following a lane and parking autonomously using computer vision techniques. The car utilizes a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and an ultrasonic sensor, DC and Servo Motors for its functionality.

## Features
Lane following: The car is equipped with a camera module that captures live video feed of the road. Computer vision algorithms process the video frames to detect the lane markings and determine the appropriate steering angle for the car to follow the lane.

Autonomous parking: The car incorporates ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and safely navigate towards a parking spot. The computer vision algorithms are used to identify parking spaces and guide the car to park automatically.

## Components Used
Raspberry Pi: The Raspberry Pi serves as the brain of the car, responsible for processing the video feed and controlling the steering and motor.

Camera module: A camera module is used to capture the live video feed of the road. It provides the visual input required for the computer vision algorithms to detect lane markings and parking spaces.

Ultrasonic sensor: An ultrasonic sensor is employed to measure the distance between the car and obstacles. It helps in obstacle detection and collision avoidance during parking.

Arduino: To control the DC and Servo motors
